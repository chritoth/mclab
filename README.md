# Mobile Computing Laboratory

This repository contains apps for (simple) activity monitoring and indoor localization for android 
smartphone. Moreover, Python notebooks used during the model developement process as well as short summary reports 
are included. The content of this repository was created in the course of the mobile computing lab @ TU Graz 
(https://github.com/osaukh/mobile_computing_lab) during the summer term 2018.


## Activity Monitoring
The Android Studio project can be found in **activityMonitoringApp**. Python notebooks for feature engineering and 
model evaluation reside in **modelDev**. A short summary report is available under **report_activity/main.pdf**.


## Indoor Localization
The Android Studio project can be found in **localizationApp**. Python notebooks for feature engineering and 
model evaluation reside in **modelDev**. A short summary report is available under **report_localization/main.pdf**. 
Finally, a video of a live demo is given in **livedemo_localization.mp4**.
